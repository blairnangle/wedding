      <h3>Getting to Tuscany</h3>
      <p>
        Montalcino is served by 3 main airports: Perugia, Florence & Pisa. Rome and Bologna are also options but they’re further away.
      </p>
      <h3>Getting to Montalcino</h3>
      <p>
        We recommend hiring a car from the airport as it’s not a short taxi journey to Montalcino and public transport is extremely limited.

        We have arranged transport to take guests from the church to the reception venue, then back to hotels/villas from 11pm onwards, until the last guest has left!
        The bus will drop you off at your accommodation in Montalcino, so please do not worry about taxis at the end of the night.
      </p>
      <h3>In and around Montalcino</h3>
      <p>
        Montalcino is tiny and can be walked from one end to the other in about ten minutes. The town is situated on top of a hill, so be prepared for steps.
      </p>
      <h4>Taxis</h4>
      <p>
        If you are staying at a hotel, your best bet is to get them to call a taxi for you. Otherwise, we have a list of local taxi numbers:
        <ul>
          <li>Giovanni +393384315291</li>
          <li>Walter +393471938291</li>
          <li>Nadia +393485702298</li>
          <li>Pierangioli Limousine +393483924780 (long transfers)</li>
          <li>Paolo Batignani nccmontalcino@gmail.com</li>
          <li>Lello Tinelli: info@andiamotaxiandtrips.com</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a dearth of public transport—as far as we can tell there is one public bus, the infrequent 114 to Buonconvento.
      </p>

      <h3>Wedding day transport</h3>
      <p>
        Minibuses will take you from the Duomo in central Montalcino to the venue and back to your accommodation when you’re ready to call it a night.
