      <h1>Montalcino</h1>
      <p>
        Montalcino is a tiny historical hilltop town famous for its wine, Rosso and Brunello di Montalcino, perched 564 meters above sea level (it can get cold when the sun goes down).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are beautiful views from Montalcino that look out to vineyards and Val d'Orcia. In the town's main piazza with the bell tower and the streets off it, you’ll find cafes, restaurants and plenty of wine shops offering tastings.
        The town itself can be explored in a couple of hours.
      </p>
      <h3>Bars and restaurants</h3>
      <p>
        You'll find a mixture of cafes, traditional Tuscan tavern-like trattorias, fancier restaurants and wine tasting shops that also do food. The town is very popular with wine tourists, so there is a high density of eateries and drinkeries.
      </p>

        We've put together a
        {' '}
        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QJ2z4ULrBrRFCBQz8">wee Google Maps list</a>
        {' '}
        of places we've been to or had recommended to us.
      </p>
      <h4>Things to bear in mind</h4>
      <p>Places shut quite early. Plan accordingly.</p>
      <p>There are no substantial supermarkets in Montalcino, so stock up on supplies en route if you're in self-catered accommodation.</p>
      <h3>Wine</h3>
      <p>Within a five-mile radius of Montalcino there are more than 263 Brunello vineyards, so go mad.</p>
      <h3>Sightseeing</h3>
      <p>° The 14th century fortress at the top of the town is the best spot for beautiful views of the valleys below</p>
      <p>
        ° You can drive (or walk for six miles) from Montalcino to the ancient
        {' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Sant%27Antimo">Abbey of Sant'Antimo</a>
        . It's a lovely walk with panoramic views going over hills and through forested hillsides, and the Abbey stands alone in a vale surrounded by woods and olive groves. Afterwards, you can have lunch in the nearby hill town of Castelnuovo dell'Abate and then take a 10-minute taxi ride back.
      </p>
      <p>
        ° Another ancient medieval village just four miles away from Montalcino is Sant'Angelo in Colle—a small jewel nestled among the vineyards of Brunello. It is famous for the unique 360-degree view that opens between Monte Amiata, Val d'Orcia and the Tyrrhenian sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        ° There are several electric bike companies in Montalcino
      </p>
      <p>
        ° And of course for the steam heads, there is a
        {' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Sant%27Antimo">train</a>
        {' '}
        that will take you from Siena to Montalcino and back again (not actually that helpful but looks cool)
